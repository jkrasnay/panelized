Migration

- remove details from DTP into composed controls
    - DTP keeps current page, but pagination controls are a header component
    - move filters to filter header component, interacts with DTP and DataProvider
    - move actions, moves to ToolsColumn
    - URL parameters
        - to formulate URL parameters, iterate over DTP and all added controls, 
          asking each for their parameters
        - to initialize, iterate over added controls, passing in URL parameters
          and asking them to initialize themselves
          
- perhaps we should leave out the AccessController mechanism, let the app do
  it before adding the actions
